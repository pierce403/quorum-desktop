/**
 * The instrument this refactor's second tranche exists to leave behind.
 *
 * The 24-row migration table that drove Phase D was built from "which files
 * import a name resolver" — so a file that never imported one (it just
 * rendered `member.display_name` or `currentPasskeyInfo.displayName`
 * straight from a query/prop, no resolver in sight) was invisible to that
 * table AND to the eslint ratchet that guards resolver imports. Two of that
 * exact class were found by the operator driving the app (a crashing modal,
 * a nav-rail tooltip showing the wrong name); the rest — the search hooks,
 * the moderation modals, `ConversationSettingsModal` — were found only by a
 * manual audit. This test is that audit, made permanent.
 *
 * WHAT IT SCANS: `src/components/**` and `src/hooks/business/**` — the
 * render + display-shaping layers, where every real defect in this class has
 * lived. Deliberately EXCLUDES `src/hooks/queries/**` and `src/hooks/mutations/**`
 * (the data-fetching boundary: a fetcher or query-key builder reading
 * `response.display_name` off a raw API/DB payload is the data layer doing
 * its job, exactly like `identityProvider.tsx`'s own internal reads — it is
 * not a RENDER, and there is nowhere else for that read to happen). Also
 * excludes `src/identity/**` itself (the one module allowed to own this) and
 * `src/components/primitives/**` (SCSS-only re-export shims, no logic).
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS AN OFFENSE: a file that (a) references one of the five raw
 * member-name fields (`displayName`, `primaryUsername`, `globalDisplayName`,
 * `display_name`, `primary_username`) as a plain identifier — a property
 * read (`x.displayName`) or a destructure (`{ displayName }`) — AND (b) does
 * NOT import anything from `src/identity`. Condition (b) is the load-bearing
 * half: a component that already imports `useResolvedName`/`<MemberName>`
 * and ALSO happens to have a prop or local named `displayName` (an avatar
 * receiving an already-resolved BARE name, say) is not the bug this exists
 * to catch — the bug is a raw field reaching the screen with NO resolver
 * anywhere in the file. This is why `UserAvatar.tsx` (receives an
 * already-resolved name as a prop, never looks anything up itself) is a
 * genuine exception below rather than something papered over by the import
 * check.
 *
 * HONESTY, NOT COVERAGE: this is a grep-shaped heuristic, not a type-aware
 * linter — it cannot tell a resolved local variable named `displayName` from
 * a raw prop of the same name inside a file that imports identity for an
 * unrelated reason, and it cannot see through a re-export or a renamed
 * import. It exists to make the CLASS of bug loud again, not to replace
 * review. Keep the exceptions list honest: every entry needs a one-line
 * reason a reviewer can check against the file, not a rubber stamp.
