# Quorum Desktop

The world's first fully private and decentralized group messenger.
Powered by Quilibrium and the libp2p stack, Quorum can be used over TCP, QUIC, Websockets, or even LoRa — so it can run across the traditional internet, local networks, or off-grid setups.

**Available Platforms:**

- **Web Browser** - [Live app (beta)](https://app.quorummessenger.com/)
- **Desktop** - Electron wrapper for native desktop experience
- **Mobile** - [quorum-mobile](https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-mobile) (React Native + Expo)

- [Official website](https://www.quorummessenger.com/) - [FAQ](https://www.quorummessenger.com/faq)

## Repository Ecosystem

Quorum is built as a **multi-repository ecosystem** where shared functionality is centralized:

| Repository | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **[quorum-desktop](https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-desktop)** | Web + Electron desktop app (this repo) |
| **[quorum-mobile](https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-mobile)** | React Native + Expo mobile app |
| **[quorum-shared](https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-shared)** | Shared types, hooks, sync protocol (`@quilibrium/quorum-shared`) |

All clients sync data via the same protocol defined in `quorum-shared`, ensuring messages, bookmarks, and user settings stay in sync across all devices.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on specific features and components, please refer to the [`.agents/docs`](.agents/docs) directory. You can find the complete index of available documentation in [`.agents/INDEX.md`](.agents/INDEX.md).

**Key Documentation:**

- [Quorum Ecosystem Architecture](.agents/docs/quorum-shared-architecture.md) - Multi-repo system and shared package
- [Component Management Guide](.agents/docs/component-management-guide.md) - Creating cross-platform components
- [Cross-Platform Architecture](.agents/docs/cross-platform-repository-implementation.md) - How the shared codebase works

## Development Resources

The [`.agents/`](.agents) folder contains development resources including:

- Architecture documentation and component guides
- Bug reports and solutions
- Task management ([pending & ongoing](.agents/tasks), [completed](.agents/tasks/.done))
- Mobile development guidelines and cross-platform considerations

### Development Tools

The [`src/dev/`](src/dev) folder contains development utilities:

- **Dev tools** (`/dev`) - Hub for the current available development tools
- **Documentation Viewer** (`/dev`) - Interactive frontend for browsing docs, tasks, and bug reports from the `.agents/` folder
- **Primitives Playground** (`/playground`) - Web-based testing environment for UI primitives and components
- **Mobile Playground** - Comprehensive testing environment accessible by running the mobile app (see Mobile Development section)

#### Headless DM harness

[`src/dev/tests/harness/`](src/dev/tests/harness/README.md) runs the **real desktop
client in Node** - both sides of a conversation, no browser, no devices. It exists
for the DM transport investigation: reproducing decrypt failures, measuring
send-vs-arrive loss, and testing session recovery unattended.

```bash
yarn harness dm-basic      # two bots exchange DMs both ways
yarn harness dm-reorder    # reproduces the upstream decrypt failure in ~35s
yarn harness dm-loss       # send-vs-arrive accounting per direction
```

A sibling harness drives the **mobile** client the same way
(`quorum-mobile/dev/harness/`, `yarn harness:dm`).

Scenarios talk to the production relay and register real accounts, so use
throwaway or dedicated test accounts only. The harness README covers setup, the
full scenario list, and what the bench deliberately does *not* cover.

For the investigation these support, start at
[`.agents/docs/transport-reliability-index.md`](.agents/docs/transport-reliability-index.md).

#### Accessing Development Tools

After running `yarn dev`, you can access the development tools at: `http://localhost:[port]/dev`

#### Testing with Mock Data

Add `?users=N` to any URL to generate mock users/contacts for testing:

```
# Space members list (1000 mock users)
http://localhost:5173/spaces/{space-id}/{channel-id}?users=1000

# Direct messages list (50 mock contacts)
http://localhost:5173/messages?users=50
```

**localStorage (persistent across sessions):**
```javascript
// Enable mock users (Space members)
localStorage.setItem('debug_mock_users', 'true')
localStorage.setItem('debug_mock_count', '1000')

// Enable mock conversations (DM contacts)
localStorage.setItem('debug_mock_conversations', 'true')
localStorage.setItem('debug_mock_conversation_count', '50')

// Disable
localStorage.removeItem('debug_mock_users')
localStorage.removeItem('debug_mock_conversations')
```

## Setup and Development

### Prerequisites

Requires Node.js, plus two sibling repositories cloned next to this one:

```
your-git-folder/
├── quorum-desktop/              ← this repo
├── quorum-shared/               ← github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-shared
└── quilibrium-js-sdk-channels/
```

> **`@quilibrium/quorum-shared` is linked locally, not installed from a registry.**
> `package.json` declares it as `"link:../quorum-shared"`, so `yarn install` symlinks the sibling folder directly into `node_modules`. The folder must be named exactly `quorum-shared` and sit next to `quorum-desktop`, otherwise the install fails. There is no published package to fall back on.

When running locally in a browser, calls to the prod Quorum API are routed through the Vite dev server proxy (see `web/vite.config.ts` → `server.proxy`), so the browser only ever talks same-origin and no CORS workaround is needed. You do **not** need to disable browser CORS or install a CORS-unblocking extension. The proxy is dev-only; production and Electron builds call the API directly and are unaffected.

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. SDK: build it and register a global yarn link
cd ../quilibrium-js-sdk-channels/
yarn build
yarn link

# 2. Shared package: install deps and build dist/
#    dist/ is gitignored, so a fresh clone ships no build output
cd ../quorum-shared/
yarn install
yarn build

# 3. This repo
cd ../quorum-desktop/
yarn link @quilibrium/quilibrium-js-sdk-channels
yarn install
```

Note the asymmetry: the SDK uses `yarn link` (a global link registered by the SDK repo), while `quorum-shared` needs no link command at all, since the `link:../quorum-shared` entry in `package.json` makes `yarn install` create the symlink for you.

### Working on `quorum-shared`

The app imports the **built** output (`dist/index.mjs`), not the TypeScript source. Editing `quorum-shared/src` has no effect on this app until you rebuild:

```bash
cd ../quorum-shared/
yarn build   # one-off rebuild
yarn dev     # or watch mode: rebuilds on every save
```

Vite picks up the new `dist` on the next reload. If the app still serves stale shared code, run `yarn dev:clean` here to drop Vite's cache.

### Web Development

To run the web app in development:

```bash
yarn dev
```

On Linux, if the host has exhausted its inotify watcher pool (`ENOSPC`), use
the polling fallback:

```bash
CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true yarn dev
```

To run in Electron desktop app:

```bash
yarn dev

# In another terminal
yarn electron:dev
```

That hot-reload command enables privacy-safe Electron diagnostics. To exercise
the built renderer and the same `quorum-app://app` storage origin as a release,
without creating an installer:

```bash
yarn electron:dev:bundle
```

To create an explicitly marked diagnostic package, use:

```bash
yarn electron:build:dev
```

The diagnostic artifacts are named **Quorum Dev** and written to
`release-dev/`. The embedded `dist/quorum-dev-build.json` marker keeps
diagnostics enabled when that package is launched without shell environment
variables. A normal `yarn electron:build` starts with a clean Vite output and
does not include the marker.

Development Electron logs live at `logs/quorum-dev.ndjson` under Electron's
`quorum-desktop` user-data directory. They contain fixed-schema status metadata
only: renderer console text, message content, private keys, keysets, and ratchet
material are deliberately excluded. At startup, a log that has reached 5 MiB
is rotated to `quorum-dev.ndjson.1`, and both files are owner-readable only.

All current Electron run modes use that same `quorum-desktop` profile and the
stable `quorum-app://app` renderer origin. Accounts created by older development
builds under the generic `Electron` profile or a localhost/file origin are not
copied automatically; Chromium keeps origin-scoped key stores isolated. That
legacy data is left untouched, and those accounts should be recovered through
the app's account-import flow.

To build for production and preview:

```bash
yarn build:preview
```

### Mobile Development

The mobile app lives in a separate repository: **[quorum-mobile](https://github.com/QuilibriumNetwork/quorum-mobile)**

Both apps share code via the `@quilibrium/quorum-shared` package. See [Quorum Ecosystem Architecture](.agents/docs/quorum-shared-architecture.md) for details on the multi-repo setup.

## Translation Workflow

> All the existing translations (apart from English) have been created using an LLM.  
> Communities are welcome to proofread and correct them. We are setting up a dedicated platform to do just that.
> **Proofreading completed for**: English, Italian.

### To Correct an Existing Language

1. Correct the file: `src/i18n/<locale>/messages.po`
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   yarn lingui:compile
   ```
   This updates the `messages.js` file in `src/i18n/<locale>/messages.js`.
3. Commit the changes and push to the remote repository.

### To Add a New Language

1. Add the language to `locales.ts` in: `src/i18n/locales.ts`
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   yarn lingui:extract
   ```
   This creates the `.po` file in `src/i18n/<new-locale>/messages.po`.
3. Translate the messages in the `messages.po` file.
   - To translate via LLM, you can use: [po-files-translator](https://github.com/lamat1111/po-files-translator) (even if you choose to use an LLM, it's important to proofread the final text)
4. Run the command:
   ```bash
   yarn lingui:compile
   ```
   This creates the `messages.js` file in `src/i18n/<new-locale>/messages.js`.
5. Commit the changes and push to the remote repository.
