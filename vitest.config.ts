    // is never initialised, so every scenario fails on `js_generate_ed448` or on a
    // missing lingui locale. They were failing this suite (8 files) purely for that
    // reason. Run them with `yarn harness`.
    // `security/**` belongs to vitest.security.config.ts and CANNOT run here.
    // Those tests must execute against the PRODUCTION build of react-dom, which
    // is the only build whose behaviour is worth asserting; this config runs the
    // development build, where they self-detect and fail on purpose. Run them
    // with `yarn test:security`.
    // `perf/**` belongs to vitest.perf.config.ts and MUST NOT run here. Those are
    // load-generating benchmarks, and extra CPU contention raises the failure rate
    // of the suite's timing-sensitive tests.
    // Measured 2026-08-13, and stated carefully because the two effects are easy to
    // conflate: `websocketInboundPickup` and `fetchSpaceReplies` are ALREADY
    // intermittently load-sensitive — the suite failed once in 8 runs with no bench
    // present at all. Adding one bench file took that to 3 failures in 6 runs. So
    // the benches do not create the flakiness, they amplify it; both are worth
    // fixing, and keeping them apart stops a benchmark from being blamed for a
    // pre-existing flake (or vice versa). Run them with `yarn bench`.
